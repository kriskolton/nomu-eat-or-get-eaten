### Pull Requests

4. Ensure the test suite passes (when available)

## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

- Use semicolons
- Use `const` or `let` instead of `var`
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

Currently, the project doesn't have automated tests. This is an area where contributions are especially welcome! When adding tests:

- Place unit tests in a `__tests__` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email the maintainers directly instead of creating a public issue. We take security seriously and will respond promptly.
